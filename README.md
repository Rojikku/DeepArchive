An Archive Tool for Organizing File Libraries
Sometimes you download hundreds of files for later use - Games, PDFs, Epubs, Pictures, Whatever.
But even if you remember a file exists, it can be difficult to remember exactly which one it was.
After a while you can't even remember what exactly that file name meant without opening it, and who wants to open that many files?

The goal for DeepArchive is to allow users to organize their files with features like:
* Representative Images
* Descriptions
* Searchable Tags
* Related files in sets
