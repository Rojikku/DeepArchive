# DeepArchive
An Archive Tool for Organizing File Libraries
Sometimes you download hundreds of files for later use - Games, PDFs, Epubs, Pictures, Whatever.
But even if you remember a file exists, it can be difficult to remember exactly which one it was.

The goal for DeepArchive is to allow users to organize their files with features like:
* Representative Images
* Descriptions
* Searchable Tags
* Relations to other files

## To Do
